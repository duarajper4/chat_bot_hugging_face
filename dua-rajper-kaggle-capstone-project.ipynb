    "**## Results, Discussion, and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This final cell provides a summary of our work and discusses its implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results and Discussion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated through the example interactions, our basic Gen AI agent can understand user queries and, guided by the prompt, decide whether to provide a direct answer or to utilize one of its available (simulated) tools. The agent structures its responses in JSON format, which allows for easy parsing and further processing. The `process_agent_response` function then interprets these JSON responses and simulates the execution of function calls to provide a final answer to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation showcases the fundamental principles of building a Gen AI agent, combining **prompting** to define the agent's behavior and access to **tools (via simulated function calls)** to extend its capabilities. The use of **structured output (JSON)** facilitates the interaction between the agent and the subsequent processing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note several limitations of this basic implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simulated Function Calls:** The agent does not interact with any real-world APIs or data sources. The functions merely return pre-defined responses.\n",
    "* **Limited Reasoning and Tool Selection:** The agent's ability to understand complex queries and choose the most appropriate tool is constrained by the simplicity of the prompt and the capabilities of the `gpt2` model.\n",
    "* **Lack of Memory and Context:** This agent is stateless and cannot remember past interactions or maintain context over multiple turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work could focus on addressing these limitations by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Integrating with Real-World APIs:** Connecting the agent to live APIs for weather, search, and other services would significantly enhance its utility.\n",
    "* **Implementing Advanced Prompting Techniques:** Using more sophisticated prompting strategies, such as chain-of-thought prompting, could improve the agent's reasoning and tool selection abilities.\n",
    "* **Utilizing More Capable Language Models:** Employing larger and more advanced language models would likely lead to better understanding, reasoning, and more natural responses.\n",
    "* **Adding Memory and State Management:** Incorporating mechanisms for the agent to remember past interactions and maintain context would enable more complex and coherent conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, this notebook provides a foundational example of a Gen AI agent leveraging prompting and simulated function calling to address user queries. It demonstrates the core concepts involved in building more sophisticated autonomous systems that can interact with the world through tools.\n",
